## Overview

The objective of this exercise is to create a Virtual Network (vNet) with a default subnet using the Azure Portal, laying the foundation for a secure network architecture. You will also provision three servers having the roles Web Server, Reverse Proxy and Bastion Host respectively. Finally, firewall rules will be created to secure the network using Azure Network Security Groups (NSG)

### Step 1: Log in to Azure Portal  
1. Open [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).  
2. Sign in with your Azure account credentials.

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Network 
1. In the Azure Portal, use the search bar at the top to search for **"Virtual Networks"**.  
2. Select **Virtual Networks** from the search results or from the left menu
3. Click the **+ Create** button at the top of the Virtual Networks page.  
4. On the **Basics** tab, fill in the following information:  
   - **Subscription**: Select your subscription.  
   - **Resource Group**: Choose an existing resource group or create a new one (e.g., `DemoRG`).  
   - **Name**: Enter `DemoVNet`.  
   - **Region**: Choose a region close to your location (e.g., `North Europe`).  
5. Click **Review + Create** and then click Create to deploy the Virtual Network.  

> 💡 **Information**
>
> - A Virtual Network (VNet) is the foundation of a cloud-based network.  
> - Subnets allow logical segmentation within the VNet for better security and resource management.  
> - The address space `10.0.0.0/16` allows over 65,000 addresses, and subnets divide this range into smaller, manageable blocks (in this case the `default` subnet `10.0.0.0/24`)

> ✅ **Verification Step:**
>
> 1. After deployment, return to **Virtual Networks** in the Azure Portal.  
> 2. Select the `DemoVNet` from the list of Virtual Networks.  
> 3. Confirm that the following settings are present:  
>    - **Address Space**: `10.0.0.0/16`.  
>    - **Subnets**: `default` with address range `10.0.0.0/24`.

### Step 2: Provision an Ubuntu VM in the VNet/Subnet (Web Server)

1. In the Azure Portal, go to **"Virtual Machines"**
2. **Create a New Virtual Machine**
   - Click **+ Create** at the top of the Virtual Machines page. 
   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription used in Step 1.  
   - **Resource Group**: Select the same resource group as before.  
   - **Virtual Machine Name**: Enter a name, e.g., `WebServer`.  
   - **Region**: Use the same region as the VNet.  
   - **Image**: Choose **Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS**.  
   - **Size**: Select a small size, e.g., `Standard_B1s`.  
   - **Administrator Account**:  
     - Authentication Type: Select **SSH Public Key**.  
     - Username: Enter `azureuser`.  
     - SSH Public Key: Generate new key pair.
 
   - Go to the network tab
	   - Under **Virtual Network**, select the VNet created in Step 1.  
	   - For **Subnet**, choose the default subnet created in Step 1.  
	   - **Public IP**: Ensure a public IP address is assigned.  
	   - **NIC Network Security Group**: Select **Basic** and allow SSH (port 22).
	   
   - Go to the advanced tab
	   - Use custom data to install nginx
		   
		```bash
		#!/bin/bash

		apt update
		apt install nginx -y
		```
		
   - Click **Review + create** and then **Create**.

### Step 3: Configure the Web Server

1. Login to the WebServer and change the default Nginx page to "Welcome World"
2. Run the following commands to change the port nginx listens to (just for this exercise to show that web servers and app servers can potentially listen to many different ports. `8080` is a very common port to use)

	```bash
	sudo sed -i 's/listen 80 default_server;/listen 8080 default_server;/' /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
	sudo sed -i '/listen \[::\]:80 default_server;/d' /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
	sudo nginx -s reload
	sudo sed -i 's/Welcome to nginx/Hello World/g' /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
	```

	> ✅ **Verification Step:**
	>
	> 1. Run curl and verify output from default page
	> 
	> 	```bash
	> 	curl localhost:8080
	> 	```
	>   

### Step 4: Provision another Ubuntu VM in the VNet/Subnet (Reverse Proxy)

1. Create another identical VM (including installing Nginx)
2. Name it `ReverseProxy`

### Step 5: Configure the Reverse Proxy

1. Login to the ReverseProxy and run

	```bash
	curl <PrivateIP_WebServer>:8080
	```
	
	> ✅ **Verification Step:**
	>
	> Verify output from default page of the Web Server

	> 💡 **Information**
	>
	> - There is no firewall between servers in the same network
	> - You can also use the private IPs within the same vNet

	

2. In order to give the Reverse Proxy its role as "Reverse Proxy" we need to edit the file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`. Replace the content with this (change the Private IP and Port):

	```bash
	sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
	```
	
	```bash
	server {
	  listen        80 default_server;
	  location / {
	    proxy_pass         http://<PrivateIP>:<Port>/;
	    proxy_http_version 1.1;
	    proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
	    proxy_set_header   Connection keep-alive;
	    proxy_set_header   Host $host;
	    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
	    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
	    proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
	  }
	}
	```
	
	```bash
	sudo nginx -t
   sudo nginx -s reload
   curl localhost
	```

	> ✅ **Verification Step:**
	>
	> Verify output from default page of the Web Server


	> 💡 **Information**
	>
	> Nginx is a very versatile software that beside being used for web servers it is also very often used for reverse proxies. 

### Step 6: Provision another Ubuntu VM in the VNet/Subnet (Bastion Host)

1. Create another identical VM (but don´t install Nginx)
2. Name it `BastionHost`

### Step 7: Use the Bastion Host to SSH in to the other servers

1. Login to the Bastion Host.
2. Try to login to the other two servers from here.

	> 💡 **Information**
	>
	> Each server has its own ssh key. We don´t want to store the keys on the Bastion Host, instead we use an ssh agent to bring the keys to the other servers in memory to the Bastion Host.

3. Exit the terminal, so that you are back on your laptop
4. Start the SSH Agent, on your laptop, and give it the keys:
	
	```bash
	eval $(ssh-agent)
	ssh-add ~/Downloads/WebServer_key.pem
	ssh-add ~/Downloads/ReverseProxy_key.pem
	ssh-add ~/Downloads/BastionHost_key.pem
	ssh-add -l
	```
	
5. SSH Jump via BastionHost using the Agent (`-A`):

	```bash
	ssh -A azureuser@<BastionHost_IP>
	```

6. Inside the BastionHost, try to SSH into WebServer using its private IP:

	```bash
	ssh -A azureuser@<WebServer_InternalIP>
	```

	> ✅ **Verification Step:**
	>
	> Verify that you could SSH into the Web Server

### Step 8: Secure the solution with NSG (Network Security Groups)

Currently there is one NSG for each NIC of each server. You will find the firewall rules in each NSG under the menu **Networking -> Network settings** for each VM.

1. Modify the NSG of the **Web Server**
	- Navigate to the `WebServer` VM
	- Select the menu **Networking -> Network settings**
	- Follow the link `WebServer-nsg`
	- Delete the row with the SSH rule.

	> ✅ **Verification Step:**
	>
	> - Verify that you **cannot** SSH into the Web Server from the Internet
	> - Verify that you **can** SSH into the Web Server from the BastionHost
	> - Verify that you **cannot** browse (HTTP) into the Web Server from the Internet
	> - Verify that you **can** browse (HTTP) into the Web Server from the ReverseProxy

2. Modify the NSG of the **Reverse Proxy**
	- Navigate to the `ReverseProxy` VM
	- Select the menu **Networking -> Network settings**
	- Follow the link `ReverseProxy-nsg`
	- Delete the row with the SSH rule.
	- Select the menu **Settings -> Inbound security rules**
	- Click **+ Add**
	- In Service, choose **HTTP**
	- Click **Add**

	> ✅ **Verification Step:**
	>
	> - Verify that you **cannot** SSH into the Reverse Proxy from the Internet
	> - Verify that you **can** SSH into the Reverse Proxy from the BastionHost
	> - Verify that you **can** browse (HTTP) into the Reverse Proxy from the Internet
	> - Verify that you get the page served by the Web Server (Hello World)
