# Hello World MVC Application

## Goal

Create a basic ASP.NET Core MVC application, run it locally, and prepare it for version control with Git.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will:

- Create a new ASP.NET Core MVC project
- Understand the basic project structure of an MVC application
- Run a web application locally
- Initialize Git for version control
- Publish your code to GitHub

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create a New ASP.NET Core MVC Application

1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to your desired project location
3. Run the following command to create a new MVC application:

```bash
dotnet new mvc -n CloudSoft
```

> ðŸ’¡ **Information**
>
> - The `dotnet new mvc` command creates a new ASP.NET Core MVC project
> - The `-n CloudSoft` parameter sets the project name to "CloudSoft"
> - This creates a folder structure with Controllers, Models, and Views folders

4. Navigate to the newly created project folder:

```bash
cd CloudSoft
```

### Step 2: Explore the Project Structure

Take a moment to explore the generated project structure:

- **Controllers/** - Contains controller classes that handle HTTP requests
- **Models/** - Contains data model classes
- **Views/** - Contains Razor view files (.cshtml) for rendering HTML
- **wwwroot/** - Contains static files (CSS, JavaScript, images)
- **Program.cs** - The application entry point
- **CloudSoft.csproj** - The project file with dependencies and configuration

> ðŸ’¡ **Information**
>
> The MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern separates an application into three main components:
> - **Models**: Data and business logic
> - **Views**: User interface (UI)
> - **Controllers**: Handle user input and responses

### Step 3: Run the Application Locally

1. Start the application:

```bash
dotnet run
```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to:

```
https://localhost:7240
```

or

```
http://localhost:5000
```

(Note: The exact port numbers may vary)

> âœ… **Verification Step:**
>
> You should see the default ASP.NET Core welcome page with links to resources and documentation.

### Step 4: Initialize Git for Version Control

1. Create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control:

```bash
dotnet new gitignore
```

2. Initialize a new Git repository:

```bash
git init
```

3. Add all files to the Git staging area:

```bash
git add .
```

4. Create your first commit:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Create ASP.NET Core MVC application"
```

> ðŸ’¡ **Information**
>
> - Git tracks changes to your codebase
> - The .gitignore file prevents unnecessary files (like build artifacts) from being tracked
> - Each commit represents a snapshot of your code at a specific point in time

### Step 5: Publish to GitHub

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
   - Name your repository (e.g., "CloudSoft")
   - Do not initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Link your local repository to GitHub and push your code:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/CloudSoft.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

> ðŸ’¡ **Information**
>
> - Replace "YourUsername" with your actual GitHub username
> - This establishes a connection between your local repository and GitHub
> - The `-u` flag sets up tracking, which simplifies future pushes

## Final Tests

### Test 1: Verify Your Web Application

1. Ensure your application is running:

```bash
dotnet run
```

2. Open a browser and navigate to the application URL
3. Verify the homepage loads correctly

âœ… **Expected Result**:
- The application runs without errors
- The welcome page appears in your browser
- You can navigate to the Privacy page using the link in the header

### Test 2: Verify Your GitHub Repository

1. Go to your GitHub account
2. Navigate to your new repository
3. Verify that your code has been pushed successfully

âœ… **Expected Result**:
- All project files are visible in your GitHub repository
- You can see your commit message
- The repository structure matches your local project
